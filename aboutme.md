Hello! I am a researcher broadly interested in all things related to crop domestication, improvement, and genetics. My journey through research began with applied breeding work in potatoes and cowpeas, transitioned into quantitative genetics of carrot for my PhD work, and is now focused on population genetics and domestication of _Brassica oleracea_, a single species which includes diverse crops like kale, cabbage, kohlrabi, Brussels sprouts, broccoli, and cauliflower.
