Hello! I am a postdoctoral researcher broadly interested in all things related to crop domestication, improvement, and genetics. Currently, I am working on an NSF-funded project to study the domestication of _Brassica oleracea_, a single species that includes diverse crops like kale, cabbage, kohlrabi, Brussels sprouts, broccoli, and cauliflower. Not convinced this is awesome? Check out this [article and infographic](http://www.businessinsider.com/broccoli-kale-brussels-sprouts-vegetables-all-the-same-plant-2015-11) that explain why this species is so cool! 

Prior to postdoc life, I completed a **PhD in Plant Breeding & Plant Genetics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison**. My dissertation work focused on understanding the genetic basis (e.g. heritability, type of gene action, quantitative trait loci) of shoot architecture in carrot, which is essential for successful crop establishment and weed management. Since most resources are understandably devoted to studying carrot roots, this was an important first step to breed varieties with improved weed competitive ability. Fun fact: carrot tops are edible and can be used to make a [great pesto](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/roasted-carrots-with-carrot-top-pesto)!

Before heading to the arctic north in WI, I finished an internship in the hot pepper breeding at Seminis-Monsanto (Woodland, CA) and an **MS in Plant Breeding at Texas A&M University**, where I studied the effects of potato bioactive compounds on prostate cancer in mice. I learned a great deal about phytochemicals and animal models, but most importantly that, in terms of improving nutritional quality of vegetables, I am much more comfortable at the plant breeding end of the spectrum. 

How did I end up working on mice in the first place? While working on my **BS in Horticulture at Texas A&M**, I was very fortunate to receive mentorship from the very talented members of the [Potato & Vegetable Legume Improvement Program](http://potato.tamu.edu/index.html), who were investigating the chemopreventive properties of different potato varieties. This experience inspired my passion and appreciation for plant breeding, and I look forward to mentoring others on their path to scientific discovery.
