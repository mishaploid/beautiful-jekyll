Finally setting up an outreach page! Stay tuned for updates, but for now posting some outreach flashcards on carrots and corn. Questions are a mix of different difficulties, and mostly designed to learn fun facts about the history, production, and current uses of each crop. Please feel free to send suggestions for new questions and I will do my best to incorporate them :) 

I really like this style of outreach for events with large booths and/or displays. The cards can be laid out and allow adults and children to go through the questions at their own pace (especially if it's crowded and volunteers are busy). They are also cheap to make (printed on regular paper, mounted on colored cardstock, and laminated). Attaching to some sort of jumpring or string is helpful to keep them all together.
